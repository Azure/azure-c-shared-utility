# Azure C Shared Utility

azure-c-shared-utility is a C library providing common functionality for basic tasks (like string, list manipulation, IO, etc.).

## Dependencies

azure-c-shared-utility provides 3 tlsio implementations:
- tlsio_schannel - runs only on Windows
- tlsio_openssl - depends on OpenSSL being installed
- tlsio_wolfssl - depends on WolfSSL being installed 

azure-c-shared-utility depends on curl for its HTTPAPI.

azure-c-shared-utility uses cmake for configuring build files.

## Setup

1. Clone **azure-c-shared-utility**

2. Create a folder called *cmake* under *azure-c-shared-utility\c*

3. Switch to the *cmake* folder and run
```
cmake ..
```

## Configuration options

In order to turn on/off the tlsio implementations use the following CMAKE options:

* `-Duse_schannel:bool={ON/OFF}` - turns on/off the SChannel support
* `-Duse_openssl:bool={ON/OFF}` - turns on/off the OpenSSL support. If this option is use an environment variable name OpenSSLDir should be set to point to the OpenSSL folder.
* `-Duse_wolfssl:bool={ON/OFF}` - turns on/off the WolfSSL support. If this option is use an environment variable name WolfSSLDir should be set to point to the WolfSSL folder.
* `-Duse_http:bool={ON/OFF}` - turns on/off the HTTP API support.
